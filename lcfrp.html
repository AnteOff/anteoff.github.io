            The Lower Cape Fear River Program is a large-scale water quality and
            environmental assessment program covering the Cape Fear River
            Estuary and a large portion of the lower Cape Fear River watershed.
            A collaboration of academia, government, industry, and the public,
            the program is located at and administered by the Center for Marine
            Science at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Program
            objectives are to develop an understanding of the fundamental
            scientific processes shaping and controlling the ecology of the Cape
            Fear River system and provide a mechanism for information exchange
            and public education. With the commencement of monitoring in all
            three basins, regulators will have comprehensive scientific based
            information with which to form educated decisions regarding
            activities in the Cape Fear River basin.

          <h2 class="unset">What we started with</h2>
          <p>
            Researchers produced complex spreadsheets full of data that they
            would work by hand to process statistics for their reports which
            usually involved entire weeks of work. Impossibly complex for anyone
            outside of the lab to read
          </p>

          <h2 class="unset">Next Steps</h2>
          <p>
            We had a basic web app set up to process complex data and output. We
            programmed scripts to handle the data and process reports that would
            save researchers weeks of work in an instant

          <h2 class="unset">Final Iteration</h2>
          <p>
            I've designed the final iteration of the web app after consulting
            with stakeholders about expanding the current web app to be more
            intuitive and user friendly
